# Agriculture-Monitoring-and-Irrigation-automation-System-
To develop an iot based project that will help us monitor the moisture in the soil and to irrigate it when necessary. 
The detection of the moisture shall be done by the soil moisture sensor and if the water content is low then we can irrigate the plant with a nearby small water pump .
